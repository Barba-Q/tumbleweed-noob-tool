# tumbleweed-noob-tool (current version 0.8)
A small script for openSuse Tumbleweed to... 
- install popular software, tools and drivers with a few ticks
- automatically reinstall software from previous linux installations by locating existing configuration files in your home folder
- perform system upgrades with a tick (zypper dup)



## Usage:
- From most graphical file managers: 

    Simply download and start the script. Make sure it's executable.



- From Terminal:

    $PATH/ktnt_08.sh



## Requirements:
- xterm 
- zenity 

(both should be preinstalled with openSuse Tumbleweed, script will check for both anyways and inform you if something is missing)



## Notes:

I'm not a professional coder in any ways. Expect "not so clean" code, but hey, it works.

Feel free to make suggestions or changes.
