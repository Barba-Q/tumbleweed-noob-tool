# tumbleweed-noob-tool
A small script (yet) to.. 
- install popular software, tools and drivers with a few ticks
- automatically reinstall software from previous linux installations by locating existing configuration files in your home folder
- perform system upgrades (zypper dup)


Simply download and start the script.

Requirements:
xterm; zenity (both should be preinstalled with openSuse Tumbleweed, script will check for both anyways and inform you if something is missing)

Note:
I'm not a professional coder in any ways. Expect "not so clean" code, but it works.

Feel free to make suggestions or changes.
