# tumbleweed-noob-tool 
_(current version 0.94)_

A small script for openSuse Tumbleweed to... 
- install popular software, tools and hardware-drivers with a few clicks
- automatically reinstall software you had on previous linux installations by locating existing configuration files in your home folder
- perform system upgrade with a tick (zypper dup)
- One click set up for very unexperienced users, it will...

        -  add repositories for multimediapackages (Packman) and NVIDIA drivers. 
        
        - install super common software
        
                    audacity; chromium; discord; obs-studio; vlc; steam; wine; youtube-dl 
                    
        - install multimedia codecs
        
        - install microsoft licensed True Type Fonts
        
##

## Usage:
- From most graphical file managers: 

    Simply download and start the script. Make sure it's executable.


- From Terminal:

    sh $PATH/ktnt_09.sh
##

## Requirements:
- xterm 
- zenity 

(both should be preinstalled with openSuse Tumbleweed, script will check for both anyways and inform you if something is missing)

## Notes:

I'm not a professional coder in any ways. Expect "not so clean" code, but hey, it works.

Feel free to make suggestions or changes.
##

## Road to 1.0:
- have a binary instead of a plain script
- add current user to "games" group when installing steam controller support
- add some libs with steam installation for flawless gaming experience (some games still have issues due to missing libs on openSuse and wont work as intended)
- add some additional applications
- add more revivable software (help needed)
- lock on one nvidia driver (if both selected) OR generate pop up message if both selected
- add manuals
- purge temporary files on installation error / after system upgrade
